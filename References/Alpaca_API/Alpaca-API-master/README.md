# Alpaca API Issue Tracker
This repository is meant to act as a centralized collection of any **bugs** or **feature requests** for the Alpaca API. If your question relates to a specific API library maintained by Alpaca, please open your issue in that library's repository instead. Please also check our [API documentation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/) for answers before opening an issue.

## Opening Tickets (Use the templates)
Before opening a new ticket to ask a question or request a feature, please search in the [existing issues](https://github.com/alpacahq/Alpaca-API/issues) to see if there's a similar ticket open. If so, feel free to add your thoughts as a comment, or just give the ticket a thumbs-up reaction to indicate that you feel it's important.

If you don't find an existing issue similar enough to your situation, you can open a new issue, following the **appropriate template**.
Please fill out as much information as possible within the template, as that will allow us to address your issues much faster.
If your error involves more than a few lines of code and could be a **coding error**, please ask around in the [Alpaca Community Slack](https://alpaca.markets/slack) first.
